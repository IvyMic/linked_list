I'm really interested by the concept of linked lists, particularly for its
use in things like an undo function. This should be cool.


Post thoughts

It was tricky to get my head around, but once I overcame that coming up with
the methods wasn't too difficult. I made it more difficult on myself though
by always starting from square one so to speak. I realised later on that
the methods I made could be used to make other methods. I tried to incorporate
this concept in the remove_at method. Perhaps I should have done so for other
methods as well, but it was good practice nonetheless. Overall I really enjoyed
this one.

Things I need to improve on:
1) Take a 'lazier' approach. utilize the methods you make, no need to reinvent
the wheel, so to speak.
